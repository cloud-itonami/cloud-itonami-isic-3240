# Security Policy

This project handles games-and-toys-plant, production-batch and
crew-safety coordination workflows. Treat vulnerabilities as
potentially high impact even when the demo data is synthetic --
production-batch records feed consumer-facing toy-safety claims for
products used by children.

## Do Not Disclose Publicly

Report privately before opening public issues for:

- credential exposure
- real plant, batch or crew data exposure
- authorization bypass
- Toys & Games Plant Operations Governor bypass
- audit-ledger tampering
- over-disclosure in reports or exports
- tenant isolation failures

## Reporting

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting when available for the repository.
If that is unavailable, contact the repository maintainers through the
cloud-itonami organization before publishing details.

Include:

- affected commit or version
- reproduction steps
- expected and actual behavior
- impact on plant/batch data, policy enforcement or audit logging
- suggested fix, if known

## Production Guidance

- Store secrets outside Git.
- Keep real plant/batch/crew data outside this repository.
- Run policy tests before deployment.
- Export and review audit logs regularly.
- Use least privilege for operators and service accounts.
